I am an interdisciplinary scientist that uses a combination of field surveys, experimental approaches, remote sensing, stable isotope analysis, and modeling to understand how ecosystems function and quantifying the drivers of consumer distribution, resource use, and movement. The overall goal of my research is to develop a predictive framework to determine the response of ecosystems to spatial variability in biotic and abiotic factors and future change. My research mainly focuses on marine and coastal ecosystems. I am currently a Senior Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Institute of the Environment at Florida International University.
