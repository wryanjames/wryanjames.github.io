I am an interdisciplinary scientist interested in understanding the drivers of ecosystems at multiple scales. My research takes an integrative approach asking questions across multiple scales of ecological organization (individual-, population-, community-, and system-level) using a combination of field, experimental, and modeling approaches to test theories across multiple disciplines of ecology. The overall goal of my research is to develop a predictive framework to determine the response of biodiversity, fisheries, and ecosystem function to spatial variability in biotic and abiotic factors and future change to inform effective conservation strategies. I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in the Institute of the Environment at Florida International University.
