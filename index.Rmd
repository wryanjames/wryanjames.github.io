I am an interdisciplinary scientist that uses a combination of field surveys, experimental approaches, remote sensing, stable isotope analysis, and modeling to quantify the drivers of ecosystem function. My research mainly focuses on marine and coastal ecosystems. I am currently a Senior Postdoctoral Research Associate in the Institute of the Environment at Florida International University.
